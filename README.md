This was the initial wireframe, I tried to stay pretty true to the original design although that was definitely easier said than done.

# User stories
// As a traveler I want to be able to view the top rated dining options for the 
places that I travel to as well, as be able to log my travel checklist so that I 
donâ€™t forget anything going to a new location or coming back.

//As a local I want to be able to view the best dining options by my fellow 
locals as well as give my own opinion on eatery recommendations. 

// As a user I want to be to create a checklist of my own needs as well as use 
already curated checklist to make my life easier.

# Resources used
For the most part, what I needed were within the past lessons that we completed; 
from the installations of the packages needed, to the way we create the 7 restful routes for a "fully functional app". 
I would say the one thing that I did need an external resource with was my alert 
function within my login routes; I wanted to have a way to alert the user that 
something was wrong with the login info without having to send them to completely new page 
so, my solution was the alert package that I downloaded and then placed like a 
regaular piece of javascript (although i dont think this will be the permanent 
way because it seems it is causing problems on the mobile side).

# Unsolved Problems/ Notes 
1. Mobile UI looks terrible.

1. I have a lot of empty blocks that are supposed to have thier own functionality.

1. Not as neat as I would like so will definetly work on implementing partials. 

1. Location doesnt link to google maps.

1. Add location options(so if users are going to New York, they would select New
York through some modal with other locations as well and be to see dining options
based on the state selected).

1. Users can upvote or downvote as many times as they woud like. -would like it to be once for each user.
